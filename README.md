# Jet's Better Exploration

This mod adjusts various Minecraft mechanics to better suit my vision for exploration. Check out [my video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4tr_hhNZ2s) on it for more information!

Features:
- Ancient Explorer map, obtained from cartographers after defeating the ender dragon. Leads to an ancient city.
- Sculk Vial, crafted with 5 echo shards, stores up to 30 levels.
- Ancient cities are twice as rare, in exchange woodland mansions are made 3x more common.
- Ancient city loot table now contains diamond armor and tools.
- The recovery compass is no longer craftable and can now be found in the woodland mansions (with a new texture).
- Biomes now have a variated ore distribution, and affect the growth rates of different crops. See the [Biome Diversification Catalog](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BdCvVJP3CvlerC-nFlTZc4cjzYAnAbqMJudeDgCxwGw) for more information.
- Default powered rails are now crafted with copper ingots instead of gold.
- Minecarts now travel at 12 m/s when a passenger is onboard (default was 8 m/s).
- Super powered rails are crafted with gold ingots and increase the minecarts speed up to 16 m/s.
- Increases frequency of biome dependent villager trades appearing, instead of outright overriding the pre-trade rebalance mechanic.
- Horse armor has durability.
- Horse armor can be enchanted (unbreaking, mending, protection(s), respiration, frost walker, depth strider, feather falling, soul speed).
- Horses can sprint 120% faster than their base speed.
- Horses now have a stamina bar that slowly drains the longer it sprints.
- When the stamina bar is fully drained, the horse moves 30% slower until fully recharged.
- Ice evaporates in the nether.
- Striders no longer get cold when out of lava in the nether, only when out of lava in the overworld will they get cold.
- Striders can now spawn on the nether terrain, and will not mind walking on it over lava.
- Boats no longer move quickly with ice. This can be changed with the game rule `allowIceBoatSpeed`.

Minecart logic adapted from [Audaki's Cart Engine](https://github.com/audaki/minecraft-cart-engine). Please check out their work as well!
